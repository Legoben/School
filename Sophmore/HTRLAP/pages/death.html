For example, you know when Anne was talking about a woman killing herself because books were banned or something? Why did she kill her self with fire? Why did she kill herself at all? The death wasn't entirely necessary from what I got from it. But, the deeper meaning would be that of the fact that she would rather have her end the same way as the books than to be restricted of knowledge such as the antagonists seem to be doing.</div>
