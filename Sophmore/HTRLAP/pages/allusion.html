	    <div id="text-wrapper"><h2>No Book is Original</h2>Every book alludes to other books, and those books allude to other one. This is called intertextuality, and it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Intertextuality allows readers to understand the content better, if this scene is like that scene I saw in that other book, then I am able to relate it, and help predict what come next.</div>
